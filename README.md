# NES Emulator

A Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator written in C++ using SDL2 and ImGUI.

This is a rewrite of my existing WIP emulator to use ImGUI and simplify the codebase as much as possible.

# Requirements
- SDL2
- OpenGL
- ImGUI

# Resources
- [Fix for input not working](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/2729)
- [Wiki NesDev](https://wiki.nesdev.com/)
